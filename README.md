  ## Description
  When the page loads, it renders the cars that are returned by the GET /cars endpoint. 
  When the user clicks on the "open" icon, the UI makes another API call to retrieve the car details and appear them underneath the name of the car. 
  When the user selects a car make in the filter, the UI makes another call to GET /cars with the make query parameter and then render the cars in the response.
